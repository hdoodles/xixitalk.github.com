A security audit of a US critical infrastructure company last year revealed that its star developer had outsourced his own job to a Chinese subcontractor and was spending all his work time playing around on the internet.  
去年美国一家重要基础设施公司的安全审计人员发现他们一个明星程序员把他的工作外包给一个中国的外包商，工作时间他全部在网络上闲逛。

The firm's telecommunications supplier Verizon was called in after the company set up a basic VPN system with two-factor authentication so staff could work at home. The VPN traffic logs showed a regular series of logins to the company's main server from Shenyang, China, using the credentials of the firm's top programmer, "Bob".  
公司用Verizon的网络搭建一个简单的两步认证的VPN系统，以便员工在家里也可以工作。VPN日志显示存在有规律的从中国沈阳登陆到公司主服务器的信息，用的认证信息是公司最优秀的程序员“Bob”的证书。

"The company's IT personnel were sure that the issue had to do with some kind of zero day malware that was able to initiate VPN connections from Bob's desktop workstation via external proxy and then route that VPN traffic to China, only to be routed back to their concentrator," said Verizon. "Yes, it is a bit of a convoluted theory, and like most convoluted theories, an incorrect one."  


After getting permission to study Bob's computer habits, Verizon investigators found that he had hired a software consultancy in Shenyang to do his programming work for him, and had FedExed them his two-factor authentication token so they could log into his account. He was paying them a fifth of his six-figure salary to do the work and spent the rest of his time on other activities.  


The analysis of his workstation found hundreds of PDF invoices from the Chinese contractors and determined that Bob's typical work day consisted of:  
分析他的工作站电脑，发现几百个PDF格式的清单，这些清单是从他中国分包商发来的，拼凑出来Bob每天的典型生活是这样的：

9:00 a.m. – Arrive and surf Reddit for a couple of hours. Watch cat videos  
上午9：00 - 到公司，花几个小时浏览Reddit网站，看猫视频

11:30 a.m. – Take lunch  
上午11：30 - 吃午饭

1:00 p.m. – Ebay time  
下午1：00 - 逛Ebay

2:00-ish p.m – Facebook updates, LinkedIn  
下午2：00    -  更新Facebook和LinkedIn

4:30 p.m. – End-of-day update e-mail to management  
下午4：30 - 一天最后给上司发一份邮件

5:00 p.m. – Go home  
下午5：00 - 回家

The scheme worked very well for Bob. In his performance assessments by the firm's human resources department, he was the firm's top coder for many quarters and was considered expert in C, C++, Perl, Java, Ruby, PHP, and Python.  


Further investigation found that the enterprising Bob had actually taken jobs with other firms and had outsourced that work too, netting him hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit as well as lots of time to hang around on internet messaging boards and checking out the latest Detective Mittens video.

Bob is no longer employed by the firm.   
Bob已经被公司解雇。
